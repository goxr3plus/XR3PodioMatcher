# XR3PodioMatcher
As a member of AIESEC in Greece i created this small program in order to find new StartUps fast ( actually 100 times faster ) than using traditional methods .

Mostly created for my local comitee .

# Why this may be useful to me the visitor
If you are a coder you can learn many things reading these 200 lines of code :

1) How to search on **Podio.com** through the API
2) How to parse an .html page with JSOUP
3) How to export data to .excel file

Don't forget i wrote it in just 6 hours so it's not the big thing but it worths so much :)

# What is does ?

It connect's on www.podio.com through https://github.com/podio/podio-java . I wrote some custom code to check if an Organization already belongs to another AIESEC LC , if it does it ignores it . If it doesn't it add's it on an .excel file.

Actually it is using JSOUP Java Library to get all the data from https://angel.co/greece and check them one by one.

# Hey i tried and it doesn't work.

Well in order to work you need credentials both for **Podio.com** and to generate API Keys for **Podio.com**
